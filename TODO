timing issues, which are resulting into some heavy bugs.

race condition @ ReactOS r74406 (bug @ opcodes.pyx?) (Doesn't occur when COMP_DEBUG == 1)

HDD boot on SeaBIOS. (bug @ ata.pyx?, done?)

Somewhen in a few centuries:
ACPI (win2k, ...)
AMD64

if CPUID eax input is too high, return values from CPUID eax input (CPUID[0]'s eax)
if e.g. CPUID[0] eax == 0x14:
    CPUID[0x15] == CPUID[0x16] == CPUID[0x17] == CPUID[0x18] == ... == CPUID[0x14]

handling NOP differently?

VGA:
don't malloc DAC data, do union {uchar[0x300+0x100];uint[0x100];} instead.
move the shifts of 2 from getColor to getData/setData.
use uint in getColor instead of ORing uchar's.

ATA:
Use a more C-like way of reading data

PIT:
Win9x boot only works on some machines.

VGA:
Win9x boot animation should work now, but there's still some corruption at the upper part of the screen.
